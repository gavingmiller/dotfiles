Current set of dotfiles for Gavin Miller

Borrowed heavily from Gary Bernhardt (https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles),
checkout his awesome Destroy All Software screen casts!

Terminal color schemes can be picked up from here:
https://github.com/gavingmiller/iTerm2-Color-Schemes
Although I'm not entirely sure if this is where my terminal is pulling its
colors from. ./bin/bash\_colors.sh might be the actual location.
