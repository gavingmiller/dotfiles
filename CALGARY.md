Lots of access to services/community/people in Calgary. And the community is growing.

Desk Space:

* [Assembly Coworking](http://www.assemblycs.com/)
* [The Collective](http://www.thecollective1212.space/#home1) (formerly Accelerator YYC)
* [The Commons](http://www.thecommonscalgary.com/#thecommons)

Tech Meetups/Groups:

* [JS Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/YYC-js/)
* [Ruby Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/YYC-Rb/)
* [Python Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/py-yyc/)
* [Pixels & Pints](http://www.meetup.com/pxandpints/)
* [Chic Geek](http://thechicgeek.ca/)

[Lighthouse labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/calgary) has been increasing their presence in Calgary, running their bootcamps & web dev courses, with lots of demand. Which speaks of the desire of Calgarians to enter tech. U of C also has a strong technical program (as long as you can catch the grads before the big companies -- Amazon, Facebook, etc. -- snatch them up)

You'll be able to find technical/marketing people without trouble. Accountants and lawyers are going to be harder to find (I'd wager investors too -- but haven't seen that side) that "get" startups. Those types of people exist, but in my experience a lot of it is O&G based and have those expectations/biases vs tech.

Feel free to DM or email me (me@gavinmiller.io) if you have further questions. I'm always happy to help anyone in the tech scene in yyc :D
